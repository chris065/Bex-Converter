# Bex-Converter (Binary and Hex Converter)
This is a small program written in C#. The aim of the program is to take a decimal number and covert it into either a Hex Number or a Binary number, based on what the user wants to covert it to.

Please feel free to use this program and hack it to your own satisfaction.
